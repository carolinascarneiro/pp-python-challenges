# Challenge

# Up and down
# Define a function named up_down that takes a single number as its parameter. 
# Your function return a tuple containing two numbers; 
# the first should be one lower than the parameter, and the second should be one higher.
# For example, calling up_down(5) should return (4, 6).

#My solution
def up_down(n):
    print(tuple([n-1, n+1]))

#PP Solution
# def up_down(x):
    # return (x-1, x+1)
